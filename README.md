# Tabless

This app allows you to browse and navigate through multiple web pages all in one tab so you don't have to constantly switch between tabs. Websites included are Reddit, Techcrunch, CNN, and Wikipedia. This is simply done through iframes so any website that lets users access their site through iframes can be added to the same page. Click an icon on the left to make webpage show up and click again to hide it.
